# scala-fast-vect 🐆

Fast, type-safe vector libary for Scala. This library is a port of my Purescript library [`purescript-fast-vect`](https://github.com/sigma-andex/purescript-fast-vect) which are both heavily inspired by [Idris](https://www.idris-lang.org/). A vector is list with its size encoded in the type.
